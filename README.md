# pass-testhaveibeenpwned

This python script  runs your pass-store [1] against a database of known leaked passwords[2].
The critical steps happen offline, you may find technical details at [3]. Your passwords never
leave your machine.

It is work in progress, but should be usable as is. Some (early) versions
of this software will print your plaintext-passwords to console,
so please be aware, especially in public spaces.

Simply running main should be sufficient for using this software.
